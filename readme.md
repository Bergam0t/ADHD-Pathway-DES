This project is a discrete event simulation designed to models the flow of CYP
through the newly designed ADHD diagnostic pathway.

The model is run via a streamlit app that is called by running the app.py file

The DES has various parameters that the user can change such as:
    
    - the number of appointment slots available for that activity
    
    - the % of patients that will get rejected at each stage
    
    - the cut off time for forms and/or assessments to be returned
